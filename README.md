# THIS DOES NOT WORK YET.

- It's not tested on Windows
- The monitor does not fetch all the necessary info on macos. There were rows without playerKeys. Probably a simple fix, but that goes into to backlog until next draft season.

# Yahoo Fantasy Hockey Draft Assistant

This tool creates a draft spreadsheet for your Yahoo Fantasy Hockey league and automatically tracks picks during your draft. It downloads player rankings and statistics from Yahoo, then monitors your live draft and records each pick in real-time.

## What You'll Get

A spreadsheet with:

- All available players with their ADPs and positions
- Your own custom player projections
- Real-time updates as picks are made during your draft
- League settings and team rosters
- Historical draft data

On Mac, you'll get an Apple Numbers file. On Windows, you'll get an Excel file.
