5. Press Ctrl+C to stop when your draft is finished

## Your Spreadsheet

Your spreadsheet contains these sheets:

- **Draft Board:** Main view showing all players, who drafted them (by manager name), and projected points
- **Draft Results:** Log of every pick made during the draft (auto-populated by monitor)
- **Skater/Goalie Projections:** Add your own player projections here
- **Teams:** All teams and managers in your league
- **League Settings:** Your league's scoring and roster settings
- **Pre-Draft Analysis:** Average draft position and rankings data from Yahoo

Optional settings in `.env`:

- `FILENAME=my_draft.numbers` (macOS) or `FILENAME=my_draft.xlsx` (Windows) - Change the spreadsheet filename

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" or "Python not recognized"**

- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- Make sure Python is installed and in your system PATH

**"ModuleNotFoundError"**

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)

**Yahoo authentication issues**

- Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret in `.env`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Try running `python setup.py` again

**Draft picks not updating**

- Make sure the monitor script is still running
- Check that your draft has actually started
- Verify your League ID is correct
